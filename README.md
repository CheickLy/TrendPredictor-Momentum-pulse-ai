#  Momentum Pulse AI: Viral Trend Detector Blueprint

Welcome to the Momentum Pulse AI Dashboard a blueprint demonstrating a slick, real-time data visualization interface for identifying viral trends across social media and e-commerce. This project is designed to showcase strong front-end architecture and responsive UI/UX design.

## Why i chose to build this Project

As the years go by, more and more people see themselves in careers built around social media. And what better way to get ahead of the game than by creating an AI that helps you make viral breakout posts and stay on top? This project isn’t just a static webpage; it’s a dynamic, fully functional visualization that shows my ability to turn complex data concepts (like predictive modeling and LLM analysis) into a clean, actionable user experience.

## 🧠 Skills & Technologies Demonstrated

| Category | Skill/Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Front-End & UI** | Responsive Design, Event Handling, Data Mapping, and Component Structuring. |
| **Styling** | Utility-First CSS for rapid, maintainable, and highly responsive styling. |
| **Code Structure** | Modular JavaScript for clean separation of concerns (data fetching/mapping vs. DOM manipulation). |
| **UX/Accessibility**| Implementation of robust JavaScript handlers to ensure external links open reliably across different browser environments. |

### Core Technology Stack in a Nutshell:

* **HTML5:** Structured the single-page application with semantic elements to organize the dashboard layout.
* **Tailwind CSS (via CDN):** Used exclusively for high-speed, utility-first styling, ensuring a dark-mode professional aesthetic and full responsiveness across all devices.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Programmatically injected data into the DOM, managed click events for reliable external navigation, and implemented the real-time "Last Updated" clock.
* **Simulated Data (Concept):** The dashboard concept relies on simulating outputs from **LLM Clustering** and **Time-Series Forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet)** to categorize and score trend momentum.

## 🛠️ How to Run This Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/CheickLy/TrendPredictor-Momentum-pulse-ai.git](https://github.com/CheickLy/TrendPredictor-Momentum-pulse-ai.git)
    ```
2.  **Open in VS Code.**
3.  Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"** (requires the VS Code Live Server extension).

To-do-list:
- integrate AI possibly Gemini ( data itself is mocked for the blueprint.) AI is simulated for time being.
- Test AI
- Tiktok database, Reddit database, Google Seach database, other social media.
